## Project description
In this project, we clean, store, analyze and visualize datas of taxi, uber and weather in NYC through tools requests, pandas, sqlite3 and other libraries downloaded. We firstly download datas from websited and csv files and then check the data quality. We also clean the unnecessary datas, populate missing datas and add columns in part 1. After executing them, we create a database by sqlite and add data in it in part 2. For part 3, we analyze the data by answering 6 questions. Similarity, we visualize the data to help readers understand in part 4.
