## Project description
In this project, we clean, store, analyze and visualize datas of taxi rides, uber rides and weather record in NYC from 1/1/2009 to 6/30/2015 using packages requests, pandas, sqlite3 and other libraries downloaded. We download datas from websites both programmatically and manully, then inspect and clean data. We also remove unnecessary datas, populate missing datas and add columns to dataframes. After executing them, we create a database by using sqlalchemy and sqlite3 and store data in them in part 2. For part 3, we analyze the data by writing queries to answer 6 questions. Similarity, we visualize the data in part 4 using both dataframe and queries.
